Its the child in me
That gets carried away
One day I will learn
To set it free.

But right now I need you
And a place to rest my head
No more empty streets
Broken promises.

And I dont wanna push away
The ones I love most
But lately they've been turning into dust.

And I dont wanna push away
The ones I love most
But lately they've been turning into dust.

I need your love not your money
I need your trust and company
I need your words to save me
When I fall from grace.

I need your love not your money
I need your trust and company
I need your words to save me
When I fall from grace.

Its the truth that hurts
Not your broken heart.
Things we need to change
All have fall'n apart.

And you cant just sit and wait
For the pain to fade away.
This is something that we need to face.

And I dont wanna push away
The ones I love most
But lately they've been turning into dust.

And I dont wanna push away
The ones I love most
But lately they've been turning into dust.

I need your love not your money
I need your trust and company
I need your words to save me
When I fall from grace.

I need your love not your money
I need your trust and company
I need your words to save me
When I fall from grace.

When I fall from grace.

I need your love not your money
I need your trust and company
I need your words to save me
When I fall from grace.

I need your love not your money
I need your trust and company
I need your words to save me
When I fall from grace.

When I fall from grace
Who is gonna save me.

When I fall from grace
Who is gonna save me.

When I fall from grace

When I fall
