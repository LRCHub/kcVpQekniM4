Honey don't you explain
What is going through my head

From afar am i to hear
The words that you said
From afar how do you feel
To drift apart

You'll wake
You're gonna wake in a space and there you'll stay
You'll wake
You're gonna be awake in a space and there you will stay

Where's your spine
Where's your charm
Where's your grace
For what

And you'll stay
And you'll stay
You'll wake
You're gonna wake in a space and there you'll stay

Where's your spine
Where's your charm
Where's your grace

Where's your spine
Where's your charm
Where's your grace
